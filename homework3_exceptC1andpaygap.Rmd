# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
yrbss
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.
```{r}
skimr::skim(yrbss)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}

yrbss%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour="red")+
  theme_economist()

correlation <-COR(x=yrbss$weight, y=yrbss$physically_active_7d)

yrbss%>%
  summarize(
    min_weight=min(weight, na.rm=TRUE), 
    max_weight=max(weight, na.rm=TRUE), 
    mean_weight=mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE), 
    median_weight=median(weight, na.rm=TRUE), 
    sd_weight=sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE))

```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. RUse the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}
yrbss%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=physically_active_7d))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
  theme_economist() 
#doubt

yrbss%>%
  group_by(physically_active_7d)%>%
  summarise(mean_weight=mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=physically_active_7d, y=mean_weight))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
  theme_economist()



yrbss_3plus<-
  yrbss%>%
  mutate(physical_3plus=ifelse(physically_active_7d>=3,"Yes","No"))

yrbss_3plus%>%
  group_by(physical_3plus)%>%
  summarise(number_of=n())%>%
  mutate(percentage_of=number_of/sum(number_of))

ynprop<-yrbss_3plus%>%
  count(physical_3plus)%>%
  mutate(Perc_of=n/sum(n))

```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

```{r}
#physical_ci <- yrbss_3plus %>% 
 # filter(physical_3plus=="No")%>%
  #summarize(count_it= n(), 
   #         mean_it= mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
    #        median_it = median(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
     #       sd_it = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
      #      ci_lower := mean_it + qnorm(0.025)*sd_it/sqrt(length(yrbss_3plus)), 
       #     ci_upper := mean_it + qnorm(0.975)*sd_it/sqrt(length(yrbss_3plus)))
#physical_ci

prop.test(4404,13310)

```

  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
yrbss_3plus%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight, y=physical_3plus))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_economist()
  

```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r, ci_using_formulas}

formula_ci <- yrbss_3plus %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus)%>%
  summarize(count_response= n(), 
            mean_response= mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_response = median(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_response = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            ci_lower := mean_response + qnorm(0.025)*sd_response/sqrt(length(yrbss_3plus)), 
            ci_upper := mean_response + qnorm(0.975)*sd_response/sqrt(length(yrbss_3plus)))
formula_ci

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

```{r, t_test_using_R}

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss_3plus)
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss_3plus %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Yes", "No"))
obs_diff

```



Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss_3plus %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Yes", "No"))

null_dist


```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hypothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

NULL Hypothesis - The directors' range of ratings are equal
ALTERNATIVE Hypothesis - The range of ratings are not exactly the same

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}

                      t_0.025 = qt(alpha/2, df = n-1),
                      t_0.975 = qt(1-alpha/2, df = n-1),

                      min = NULL, max = NULL)

```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

From the top dataset, we can see that *mean* salary is approximately equal to *median* salary for both genders, indicating that salary distribution is approximately symmetric based on this data. Sample standard deviations are also fairly close between the genders.

Next, we calculate critical of the Student distribution. We choose t-statistics instead of z-statistics due to low sample sizes. Finally, we calculate 95% CI-s for salary distribution of men and women. Since the confidence intervals are **non-overlapping**, we conclude that there exists a statistically significant difference in mean salaries between male and female employees of the company.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega, alternative = "less")


# hypothesis testing using infer package
mean_diff <- data_descr$mean[2]-data_descr$mean[1]

omega %>%
# specify variables
specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  
# assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
# generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
# calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means, get corresponding p-value"
calculate(stat = "diff in means")%>%
get_p_value(obs_stat = mean_diff,direction = "both")

```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough
As we can see, both tests suggest that the difference in mean salaries is significant:

- For the first test, we consider the more "strong" alternative hypothesis (i.e. female salary is lower), and get near-zero $p-value$. This leads us to the conclusion that the $H0$ of equal means is rejected in favour of the alternative at $99%$ significance level.

-For the second test, we consider two-sided $H0$, and make 1000 bootstrap samples to simulate underlying distribution. Once again, $p-value$ is near-zero, so H0 of independence (i.e. equal means) is rejected at $99%$ significance level.

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
data_descr <- favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

#Repeat the analysis from previous section:
data_descr %>% mutate(margin_of_error = sd/sqrt(n), 
                      t_0.025 = qt(alpha/2, df = n-1),
                      t_0.975 = qt(1-alpha/2, df = n-1),
                      CI_lower = mean + t_0.025*margin_of_error, 
                      CI_upper = mean + t_0.975*margin_of_error,
                      missing = NULL, Q1 = NULL, Q3 = NULL, median = NULL,
                      min = NULL, max = NULL)


```

```{r}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega, alternative = "less")


# hypothesis testing using infer package
mean_diff <- data_descr$mean[2]-data_descr$mean[1]

omega %>%
# specify variables
specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  
# assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
# generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
# calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means, get corresponding p-value"
calculate(stat = "diff in means")%>%
get_p_value(obs_stat = mean_diff,direction = "both")
```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

**Answer:** Based on the results above, extremely low $p-values$ for both tests for the difference in means suggest that there exists a statistically significant difference in mean levels of working experience between male and female workers.



## Relationship Salary - Experience ?


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
omega %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = experience, y = salary))+
  geom_point(aes(color = gender),size = 2)+
  labs(x = "Years of experience",
       y = "Annual salary",
       title = "Scatterplot of salary against experience")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "deepskyblue"))+
  geom_smooth(color = "black", se = FALSE)



```

**Answer:** Above is the scatterplot of annual salary plotted against years of experience. Local regression line (LOESS) is added to the plot to show the relationship. Notice that the marginal effect of experience on salary declines quickly. However, this might be the result of a leverage point (person with the highest experience), as suggested by the very high s.e. of regression near the rightmost end of the interval. 

There is also a very interesting side observation. All employees with zero experience (and, naturally, the lowes salaries) are females. This circumstance dramatically decrease mean statistic for female salary, exacerbating the seeming gender gap which might be actually inexistent. 

However, overall we can see that there exists a positive relationship between experience and annual salary. To test this relationship more thoroughly, let's build a linear regression model:

```{r}
regression <- summary(lm(salary ~ experience, data = omega))
#print outputs:
print(regression$coefficients)
print(paste0("R-squared: ", regression$r.squared))


```
From the above regression output, we can see that both regression coefficients are significant, hence it can be inferred that there exists a statistically significant **positive** relationship between experience and salary. Meanwhile, $R^2$ is somewhat mediocre, likely telling us that the true underlying relationship is non-linear. Indeed, testing square root of experience as the explanatory variable would suggest a higher $R^2$ of approximately 75%.


## Check correlations between the data


```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

From the faceted plot above we can infer the following findings:

1) Male employees tend to have both higher experience and higher salary.
2) Correlation between salary and experience is positive (and at least at medium strength) for both genders. It is even stronger for females.

Hence, from the statistical point of view, it is impossible to draw a definitive conclusion regarding whether or not a gender gap is present in salaries. There is actually a joint hypothesis problem, with experience being the confounding variable. A more deep analysis is required to understand the underlyng dynamics.


# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```



### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.


# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}
#rearrange the data and make it longer 
tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(4:51), names_to = "year", values_to = "value") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "IndicatorName", values_from = "value") %>% 
  
#rename the columns 
  rename(Exports = "Exports of goods and services", 
         "Government expenditure" = "General government final consumption expenditure", 
         "Household expenditure" = "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", 
         Imports = "Imports of goods and services")

#divide the value by 1e9
tidy_GDP_data[,4:20] = tidy_GDP_data[,4:20] / 1e9

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "China")
```

First, can you produce this plot?

```{r}
#set up a new datatable
plot_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  
#choose the 3 countries
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%
  
#select the needed columns
  select(c("Country", "year", "Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports")) %>% 
   

#make it longer for ggplot 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(3:7), names_to = "Indicator", values_to = "value") %>% 

#change the "year"(character) to "Year"(double)
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(year)) 
```

```{r}

#the whole ggplot
plot_data %>% 
  group_by(Indicator) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = value, color = Indicator)) + #color different indicator
  
#set the x&y axis limits and breaks  
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1970,2020), breaks = seq(1970, 2010, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,12500), breaks = seq(0,12500, by = 2500)) +
  
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  
#split into different countries
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  
#change the background color
  theme_bw() +
  
#labs the legend and titles
  labs(color = "Components of GDP",
       title = "GDP components over time", 
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD", 
       y = "Billion US$", 
       x = "")
  
```


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r}
#make a new table 
added_GDP <- plot_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Indicator", values_from = "value") %>% #here we make it longer
  
#rename the columns 
  rename(Gross_capital_formation = "Gross capital formation", 
         Exports = "Exports", 
         Government_expenditure = "Government expenditure", 
         Household_expenditure = "Household expenditure", 
         Imports = "Imports") %>% 
  
#calculate the added GDP
  mutate(Added_GDP = 
           Gross_capital_formation + 
           Exports + 
           Government_expenditure + 
           Household_expenditure - 
           Imports)
  
#compare with the original GDP

  #select the data in tidy_GDP_data we need 
merge1 <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  select(c("Country", "year", "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")) 

  #left join it into added GDP
comparison <- 
  left_join(added_GDP, merge1, by = c("Country", "year")) %>% 
  select(c("Country", "year", "Added_GDP", "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")) %>% 
  mutate(percentage_dif = (Added_GDP - `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`) / `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)
  
comparison
#Here we can see, for those 3 countries, the added GDP is similar to the given values and % difference is close too. 
```


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```



> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

#We can discover that the stage of development has some relationship with the make up of GDP. For example, the % of house hold expenditure in India is much heavier than US and Germany, which demonstrates that other parts had not developed much. Yet with the development of economics, more capital was used in investment and net export may went up because of increasing imports.

#As for Germany, there is an obvious trend of increasing net exports with investment and consumption reductio. That may due to a comparatively high degree of developmrnt, with low GDP growth and low consumption. 

#Recent years, the government has become somehow "laissez faire", and the economics growth were more related with the consumption growth. Though the US and Germany are both developed countries, it has a larger part of consumption than Germany. 

> If you want to, please change `country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")` to include your own country and compare it with any two other countries you like

#For example, I use China instead of Germany.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
